# Enhanced SMN CNV Detection Pipeline

A comprehensive and enhanced pipeline for detecting copy number variations (CNVs) in SMN1 and SMN2 genes using whole exome sequencing (WES) data. This enhanced version incorporates control gene-based normalization and dual segmentation approaches to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Overview

This enhanced pipeline processes BAM files from WES data through multiple advanced analysis modules to detect SMN1/SMN2 copy number variations with improved accuracy and clinical interpretation. The pipeline is specifically designed to address challenges in WES data including uneven exon coverage, capture bias, and occasional missing reads.

### Key Enhanced Features

- **Control Gene-Based Normalization**: Uses CFTR and RNase P (RPPH1) as stable reference regions
- **Dual Segmentation Analysis**: Combines Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- **Enhanced Confidence Scoring**: Multi-tier quality assessment with clinical significance prediction
- **Robust Missing Data Handling**: Advanced algorithms accommodate incomplete coverage
- **Batch Effect Correction**: Control gene normalization reduces technical variation

## Enhanced Pipeline Workflow

1. **Enhanced BAM File Discovery**: Automatically find and classify BAM files
2. **Dual Depth Extraction**: Extract depth for both target genes (SMN1/SMN2) and control genes (CFTR/RNase P)
3. **Control Gene-Based Normalization**: Correct for sequencing variation using stable genomic loci
4. **Allele-Specific Counting**: Count discriminating SNPs with enhanced quality metrics
5. **Dual Segmentation Analysis**: 
   - **CBS**: Recursive change-point detection for sharp boundaries
   - **HMM**: Probabilistic state inference with noise smoothing
6. **Enhanced Copy Number Estimation**: Confidence-weighted consensus calling
7. **Clinical Interpretation**: Automated pathogenicity assessment and carrier screening

## Scientific Background

### Control Gene Normalization

Whole-exome sequencing data often exhibit:
- **Uneven exon coverage** due to capture probe efficiency variation
- **Batch effects** from library preparation and sequencing
- **Missing reads** in specific genomic regions

Our pipeline addresses these challenges using control gene–based normalization:

- **CFTR** (chr7:117,120,016–117,308,718, hg38): Large, well-covered gene with stable copy number
- **RNase P (RPPH1)** (chr14:20,649,636–20,650,216, hg38): Essential gene with consistent expression

These loci serve as internal controls to normalize for:
- Sequencing depth variation
- Hybrid capture efficiency differences  
- Technical batch effects

### Dual Segmentation Approach

The pipeline employs two complementary segmentation methods:

1. **Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS)**:
   - Recursively identifies statistically significant change-points
   - Excellent for detecting sharp copy number boundaries
   - Uses t-statistics to partition data into homogeneous regions

2. **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**:
   - Probabilistically infers hidden copy number states
   - Superior noise smoothing and missing data handling
   - Models transitions between copy number states

3. **Consensus Integration**:
   - Combines CBS and HMM results using confidence-weighted voting
   - Resolves conflicts using context-specific rules
   - Provides enhanced boundary resolution

   ├── ref001.bam.bai      
   ├── control_sample.bam  # Reference sample (auto-detected)
   ├── control_sample.bam.bai
   ├── patient001.bam      # Test sample

## Enhanced Copy Number Thresholds

The enhanced pipeline uses refined Z-score thresholds with confidence scoring:

- **CN=0** (Homozygous deletion): Z-score ≤ -2.5
- **CN=1** (Heterozygous deletion): Z-score -2.5 to -1.5  
- **CN=2** (Normal): Z-score -1.5 to +1.5
- **CN=3** (Duplication): Z-score +1.5 to +2.5
- **CN=4+** (Multi-duplication): Z-score > +2.5

### Enhanced Confidence Scoring

- **High Confidence** (>0.8): High coverage, good normalization, consistent segmentation
- **Medium Confidence** (0.6-0.8): Adequate quality with minor concerns
- **Low Confidence** (<0.6): Low coverage, poor normalization, or inconsistent calls

## Enhanced Interpretation

### Clinical Significance Categories

- **Likely Pathogenic**: SMN1 CN=0 with high confidence (SMA affected)
- **Likely Benign Carrier**: SMN1 CN=1 with medium+ confidence (SMA carrier)
- **Benign**: Normal copy numbers (CN=2)
- **Likely Benign Duplication**: Gene duplications (CN≥3)
- **Uncertain Significance**: Low confidence or ambiguous calls

### Enhanced Quality Metrics

The pipeline provides comprehensive quality assessment:

- **Coverage Quality**: Minimum 10x depth recommended

- Cross-platform WES data validation

## Enhanced Troubleshooting

### Common Enhanced Issues

1. **"Control genes not available"**
   - Pipeline automatically falls back to standard normalization
   - Ensure CFTR/RNase P regions are covered in your WES design

2. **"Segmentation failed"**  
   - Check for extremely sparse coverage
   - Try single method: `--segmentation hmm` or `--segmentation cbs`

3. **"Low confidence calls"**
   - Review coverage quality and missing data rates
   - Consider increasing sample size for reference database

4. **"HMM implementation not optimal"**
   - Install hmmlearn: `pip install hmmlearn`
   - Pipeline uses custom implementation as fallback
